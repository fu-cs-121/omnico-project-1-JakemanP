# Omnico Project 1 Evaluation for Jakeman Pendleton

### CSV Data Reading and Data Processing

- Your code correctly opens the CSV file, skips the header, and splits each line into the required columns.
- Printing each cleaned line is a good debugging step that shows you are correctly accessing the file data.

### Calculating Averages and Session Counts

- You correctly update the dictionary to accumulate total happiness, total session duration, and session counts for each algorithm.
- The average happiness rating and session counts are computed and printed as per the requirements.

### Average Session Duration and Longest Session Duration

- Your loop successfully calculates the average session duration for each algorithm.
- The longest average session duration value is correctly determined (45.0 minutes in this case), though the algorithm associated with that value is not explicitly tracked.

### Identifying the Highest Average Happiness Rating

- The project requirements call for identifying which algorithm has the highest average happiness rating.
- Currently, your approach uses the last computed average (from the last iteration of the loop) to determine and print the “highest” rating. As a result, the output shows "DeepPulse" with an average happiness rating of 5.0 even though the data indicates that JoyStream should be the highest.
- Similarly, while you compute the longest average session duration by comparing averages, the corresponding algorithm name is not maintained.

**Example Correction for Determining the Best-Performing Algorithms:**  
Below is a sample code snippet that shows how you can correctly compute and match the corresponding algorithm names:

```python
# Determine the algorithm with the highest average happiness rating
highest_avg_happiness = 0
best_algorithm = ""
for alg, data in stats.items():
    avg = data['total_happiness'] / data['session_count']
    if avg > highest_avg_happiness:
        highest_avg_happiness = avg
        best_algorithm = alg
print("Highest Average Happiness Rating")
print(f"- {best_algorithm} with an average happiness rating of {highest_avg_happiness}")

# Determine the algorithm with the longest average session duration
longest_avg_duration = 0
longest_algorithm = ""
for alg, data in stats.items():
    avg_duration = data['total_duration'] / data['session_count']
    if avg_duration > longest_avg_duration:
        longest_avg_duration = avg_duration
        longest_algorithm = alg
print("Longest Average Session Duration")
print(f"- {longest_algorithm} with an average session duration of {longest_avg_duration} minutes")
```

This approach loops through the stats dictionary to correctly compare and store the algorithm name together with its computed average value, ensuring that you identify the best-performing algorithms as outlined in the project requirements.

### Report Presentation

- Your `report.md` is well-organized and clearly outlines your methodology, results, and conclusions.
- The written analysis, including your insight into the DeepPulse algorithm, is thoughtful and professional.

---

Overall, you have demonstrated a solid understanding of file I/O, data calculations, and report writing. With a small adjustment to the logic for determining the highest average happiness rating (and similarly for tracking the longest average session duration), your project will fully align with all project requirements. Great work, Jakeman!
